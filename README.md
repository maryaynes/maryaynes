# 👋 Olá, eu sou a Maria Inês! 🥔
👩🏻‍💻 Passionate Information Systems grad and current Data Science Master’s student @ Nova IMS. I love making sense of messy data, discovering hidden patterns, making them simple, and finding solutions that probably shouldn't work.<br/>

💭 Currently focusing on Data Analytics and Visualizations!<br/>
